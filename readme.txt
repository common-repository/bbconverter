bbConverter is used to convert other forums to the new bbPress 2x plugin.

== Description ==

bbConverter currently supports converting your vBulletin 3x/4x, Invision Powerboard, and BBPress 1x forums over to the new bbPress 2x plugin setup.

bbPress is forum software with a twist from the creators of WordPress which can be found at: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress/

You have the option of deciding whether or not to convert your forum users over to WordPress users as well. The transition for converting is seamless.

This plugin runs in the background and converts passwords for your users when they log in, so the process is seamless even if your old forum uses different encryption methods.

Coming Soon:

We are working on phpBB, and Xenforo conversions. Many more platforms are on the list.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the bbConverter folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate bbConverter through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go into your WordPress admin under 'Settings' and choose 'Converter'
4. BACKUP YOUR WORDPRESS DATABASE!
5. Choose the platform you want to convert from and fill in the database information. Click start
6. Once the conversion has completed, visit the WordPress Admin 'Tools' section and click 'Recount'
7. Do NOT deactivate the plugin once it is finished as it is needed for user password management unless your coming from bbpress 1x.
